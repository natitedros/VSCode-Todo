# Todo Sidebar - VS Code Extension

A simple and intuitive VS Code extension that allows you to manage your todos directly within the editor. The extension provides a sidebar where you can add, view, and mark todos as completed. You can also add todos directly from text selections in your code.


## Features

- **Add Todos**: Easily add todos by typing them into the input box in the sidebar.
- **Mark as Completed**: Click on a todo to mark it as completed (strikethrough).
- **Add from Selection**: Highlight text in your editor, right-click, and select "Add to Todo List" to create a todo from the selected text.


## Usage

1. Open the **Todo Sidebar** by clicking on the List icon in the Activity Bar.
2. To add a todo:
   - Type your todo in the input box at the top of the sidebar and press `Enter`.
   - Alternatively, highlight text in your editor, right-click, and select **Add to Todo List**.
3. To mark a todo as completed, simply click on it in the sidebar. The todo will be crossed out.
4. To remove a todo, hover over it and click the trash icon that appears.
